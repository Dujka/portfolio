        During my studies at University of Kragujevac I participated in Erasmus+
        student exchange. I decided Otto-Friedrich University in Bamberg,
        Germany was the perfect choice so I went to study there for one
        semester. During that period I stayed at international dormitory where I
        had opportunity to learn about different cultures, customs and
        languages. During this exchange, I communicated mainly in English, but
        also a bit in German. Also I had a opportunity to meet different people
        with different professions and passions. Also, I learned about different
        education system and I adapted the best of it to my practices.

        German education system is different than one in Serbia. For instance,
        at Otto-Friedrich University we had different pre-examination
        obligations. To be able to take final exam we had to do several
        projects. I am happy that I had a chance to work with native Germans as
        well as with international team.

        Also, there was cultural shock for some of international students (me
        included). During my stay in Bamberg I noticed that life differs from
        what I am used to. I got that impression that Germans are reserved,
        silent and not spontaneous. They will agree to participate in events,
        but it must be well organized. But most of us adapted to the environment
        quickly
